# Codys-Portfolio-Landing-Page
A portfolio webpage that showcases my skills as a Full Stack web developer.

## Description
- This portfolio landing page was built to allow potential employers to view my work and provide them with the necessary contact information. This page was also built to be a challenge in which I use what I have learned so far in my Full Stack training bootcamp to build a responsive functional webpage.
- Building this project has helped me understand why responsive layouts are important. Also, this project has provided me with HTML and CSS coding practice. Along with learning more about hover and before/after selectors, I have also learned more about data attributes, flexbox layouts, media queries, and the importance of using responsive units of measurement.

## User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to     contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
